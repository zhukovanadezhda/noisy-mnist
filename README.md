# 🖼️ Noisy MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project involves classifying images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, with added noise such as rotations, shifts, zooms, and lighting variations. The dataset includes 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing, all in 28×28 pixel grayscale format. The goal is to develop models capable of accurately recognizing noisy digits. We explore two model architectures:

1. **Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)**.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is derived from the MNIST handwritten digits and includes different modifications. It can be generated by:

   ```bash
  cd data
  python ../src create_noisy_digits.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:zhukovanadezhda/noisy-mnist.git
   cd noisy-mnist
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
